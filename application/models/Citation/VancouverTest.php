Prophylactic for Ca breast 1 (2%), Postmenopausal bleeding 1 (2%). All cases of vaginal hysterectomy were performed for 2nd degree U-V prolapse. Intra operative complication during surgery were two cases of haemorrhage (4%) each in both total abdominal hysterectomy and vaginal hysterectomy. There was one case of bladder injury during abdominal hysterectomy. Postoperative complication noted were febrile morbidity 1 (2%) in abdominal hysterectomy. Urinary tract infection remains the single most common febrile morbidity. There was one case of secondary haemorrhage in both type of hysterectomy. One was managed conservatively and other required laparotomy. There were three (6%) cases of wound infection in abdominal hysterectomy of two which were sanguineous discharge and one was frank pus which required secondary suture."
